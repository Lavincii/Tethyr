<br>
<li>Who is the audience?</li>
<br>
<p>(researchers, professors, students, general population, professionals in a specific field)?</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>(provide information or report original research or experiments, to entertain or persuade the general public, or provide news or information specific to a trade or industry)?</p>
<br>

<h2>Strategies</h2>
<br>
<h5>Check the facts!</h5>
<br>
<p>With Tethyr's Tools you can fact check everything yourself. But if you wish, there are many fact-checking websites available online to use. Before using one of these websites, remember, a good fact checking service will use neutral wording and will provide unbiased, authoritative sources to support their claims.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Evaluate Sources</b></p>
<br>
<li>What does the web say about this source, are they reliable? </li>
<br>
<p>Knowing this information enables you to judge the website's purpose and viewpoint. Maybe check if the site is reputable on wikipedia for a potential good start, all information should have an additional sourced publication.</p>
<br>
<li><b>Citations and evidence?</b></li>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Is information cited so that you can track down the source and verify it?</li>
<br>
<li>What evidence is used to prove the author's point? Is the evidence reliable, and is it used logically?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h5><b>Beware of:</b></h5>
<br>
<li>Websites that contain the suffix "lo" (e.g., Newslo) or that end in ".com.co".
These often present false information for satirical or other purposes.</li>
<br>
<li>Websites or people that urge you to dox an individual or organization, there are consequences.</li>
<br>
<li>Websites that have amateurish design, use ALL CAPS, and try to play on your emotions</li>
<br>
<li>Memes making the rounds on Facebook or other social media sites, make sure it's not a joke.</li>
<p>Try googling the topic of a meme or other doubtful story: if it is a legitimate news story, you'll probably find it covered by an established source like a major newspaper or TV news channel</p>
<br>
<li>Clickbait</li>
<p>Sensationalist headlines and odd photos whose purpose is not to publish legitimate news but to increase traffic at a post</p>
<br>

<h4><b>Burst your filter bubble!</b></h4>
<br>
<p>Web browsers and social media sites employ algorithms that feed you information you've shown a preference for. This so called "filter bubble" connects us to news that tends to reinforce our set views, rather than challenging us with new ideas. When conducting research for class or simply making up your mind on an issue, try these strategies:</p>
<br>
<li>Seek credible information from both sides of an issue:</li>
<br>
<p>conservative and liberal; religious and atheist; industrialized and developing nations; etc.</p>
<li>Understand people within the media can basically prey on your attention for money. So using databases that aren't influenced by your previous web searches like Tethyr and .gov websites would be good choices</li>
<br>
<li><b>Talk to people who hold views different from yours.</b></li>
<p>Expand your horizons with different perspectives, so that you may contribute to the conversation in a powerfully productive way.</p>
